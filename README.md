# Soulslike-Combat

An attempt to create a small boss fight sequence with souls-like combat.

## Motivation ##
I would like to improve my skills everyday and I like Dark Souls series and Bloodborne so I decide why not make one?

So here we are, this is where I make a prototype of a mini boss sequence of Souls-like game, I will attempt to make it look as close as possible to any souls-like games.

I apply FSM into Player Control and BT to do the AI boss. The player should be easy but the boss should be able to do any actions such as run, strafe, roll, block, attack...
